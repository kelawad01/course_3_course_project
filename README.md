# gettingandcleaningdatacourseproject
The course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data coursera


run_analysis.R is an R script that takes data from UCI HAR samsung galaxy S smartphone data and performs the following data cleaning process:

1. Merges the training and test data sets into a single dataset
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
3. Uses descriptive activity labels to name the activites in the data set.
4. Appropriately labels the data set with the variable feature names
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set (mergeddata.txt) with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
